# My experiments with learning bitcoin programming


This repository is created for the sole purpose of showcasing my learning experiments with bitcoin programming. All the code here was written while I was devouring Programming Bitcoin: How to program bitcoin from scratch (https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Bitcoin-Learn-Program-Scratch/dp/1492031496), an absolute must-read from Jimmy Song. Interestingly, Jimmy also has the entire book and exercises online (https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin) and I would highly recommend Jimmy's book to anyone who is new to bitcoin programming.


Although coming from a Java background, Jimmy's code and exercises, written in beautiful Python, were not that difficult to follow. I decided to write the code and exercises in Java for simply one reason, and that is not to fall into the trap of just flipping through the pages and make myself believe that I understand what is going on. Even worse, I could have gone one step further and just copied the python code, made some minimal changes and convinced myself that all is well. Writing all the code in Java forced me to not take the easy way out and put in the required time and effort that this endeavor deserved. I must also confess that coding in Java made me really appreciate the simplicity and power of Python. There were a lot of places were what a single line of Python could do, required lines and lines of Java, especially when dealing with array slicing! Perhaps, I am just nitpicking ... 


The code here is just experimental and as such I take no explicit or implicit responsibility for any errors and issues. There are lot of areas where the code is neither complete nor optimal but again the goal was never to come out with a commercial grade software. My objective, as stated above, is to simply share my learning experience and if it helps others in their journey, I would consider that as an added bonus.


Finally, I would like to thank Jimmy for sharing his knowledge and wisdom via the excellent book. If not for Jimmy and the the book, this project would not exist. So thanks a bunch Jimmy, I hope your journey and experiences continue to inspire many more like myself!
