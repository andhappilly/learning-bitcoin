My experiments with learning bitcoin programming


This repository is created for the sole purpose of showcasing my learning experiemnts with bitcoin programming. All the code here was written while I was devouring Programming Bitcoin: How to program bitcoing from scratch (https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Bitcoin-Learn-Program-Scratch/dp/1492031496), an absolute must-read from Jimmy Song. Interestingly, Jimmy also has the entire book and exercises online (https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin) and I would highly recommend Jimmy's book to anyone who is new to bitcoin programming.
